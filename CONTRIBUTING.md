This is just a test repository.

If you wish to contribute something please use the following coding guidelines:
  
  - indentations are 4 spaces
  - We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters ([1, 2, 3], not [1,2,3]), 
    around operators (x += 1, not x+=1), and around hash arrows.
  - This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them.
